# PySTDF Lite

## Description
PySTDF Lite is a lite version of PySTDF developed by Casey Marshall, https://github.com/cmars/pystdf, where the main
goal is to extract parametric and associated metadata into wide data frames.

## Output files
PySTDF Lite produces two data frames in CSV format and a JSON file for metadata:
- Parametric data frame in wide format.
- All columns in the parametric data frame with corresponding limits.
- Metadata in JSON format.

## Acknowledgement
I would like to express my sincere gratitude to Casey Marshall who open-sourced this project.
